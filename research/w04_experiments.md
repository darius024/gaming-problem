## w04 — experiments

### Done
- Started W04.
- Added a minimal run registry script to index runs.

### Decisions
- Keep the registry lightweight and derived from `config.json` + `summary.csv`.

### Artifacts
- Added: `scripts/run_registry.py`
- Updated: `README.md`, `research/index.md`

### Open questions
- Should the registry include selected wrapper ids from search runs?

### Next
1. Decide whether to add more registry fields.
