## Research log index

Append-only log index for `research/`.

Guidelines:
- Keep logs **minimal** (bullets, no long prose).
- No dates/timestamps/day numbers inside logs.
- Each log file should end with a short **ordered** “Next” list.
- Add new log files here in week order (`w01`, `w02`, ...), newest at bottom.

- `research/w01_setup.md`
- `research/w02_experiments.md`
- `research/w03_plan.md`
